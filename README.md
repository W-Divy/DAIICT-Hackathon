# Fine-tuned DistilBERT Model for Deforestation Reports

## Files Included:
1. `nlp_model_deforestation.zip` - Contains the saved model and tokenizer
2. `nlp_model_usage.py` - Example code for loading and using the model
3. `requirements.txt` - Required Python packages

## Quick Start:
1. Unzip `nlp_model_deforestation.zip`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Use the model as shown in `nlp_model_usage.py`

## Important:
- Update the `class_names` list in the script with your actual class labels
- The model expects the same text preprocessing as during training
